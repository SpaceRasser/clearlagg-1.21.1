## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Upon first run, a config file is generated at:

```
config/clearlagmod-common.toml
```

Customize the following settings:

```toml
[general]
# Interval between cleanups (seconds): 60‚Äì86400
clearIntervalSeconds = 1800

# Warning times before cleanup (seconds)
warningSeconds = [300, 60, 10]
```

* **clearIntervalSeconds**: How often to perform the item purge.
* **warningSeconds**: When to broadcast warnings before each cleanup.

*Save* the file and changes will activate automatically on the next configuration reload.
